# Shop-Shop Redux-Refactor Project

## User Story

*`AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.`*

## Functionality Overview

Shop-Shop is an e-commerce platform that uses Redux instead of Context API to manage global state.

*`Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.`*

Shop-Shop's React front end access the store via a Redux provider.

After refactoring, Shop-Shop now uses a Redux store in place of the Context API to determine changes to its global state.

Shop-Shop has been updated to leverage Redux instead of the Context API to extract state data from the store.

Shop-shop now dispatches actions with Redux instead of the Context API.
